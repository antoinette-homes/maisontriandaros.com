# ABOUT

Welcome to our little paradise!

My name is Antoinette and I am a young pensioner from Switzerland who fell in love with the Cyclades and in particular with the island of Tinos.

I had a strong crush on this place and I am since 2018 the happy owner of Maison Triandaros. I am very enthusiastic to welcome everyone here who wants to discover this wonderful area.

The Island is full of magnificent treasures that are loved by people of different backgrounds, ages, interests and physical conditions.

The Island is not only awesome to see, but it is also great to taste and to feel!
