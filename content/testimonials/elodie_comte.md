We have discovered beautiful places on this amazing island. Tinos is still very well preserved from mass tourism. It is very easy to get in touch with locals. They are very approachable and friendly and they had plenty of things to teach us about the island. The centre of the village is very cute. You will find many small markets, typical restaurants and a lot of kind people.
