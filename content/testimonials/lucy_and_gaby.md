My last holidays and I hope my next.

Antoinette is a wonderful and a nice woman. She prepared for us every morning a brunch so that we could be free all the day to travel through the Island. So many things to see, to taste.

And in the evening, in Chora Tinos or in many villages, we found, taverna, restaurants cheap or expensive, the choice, but always good....

This island is wonderful and people very kind.

We've liked also the breakfast and to play taveli under the pergola.
